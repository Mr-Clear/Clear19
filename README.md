  Logitech G19 Linux Daemon
============================

  About
-------

  Now it just show countdown (personal date hardcoded) and listening my [ambient_light](https://bitbucket.org/GRayHook/logiled_ambient/src/master/) for G13 and G19.

  Maybe libdraw will be useful for you. Libdraw allow you to draw some shapes and place pics on screen. It able to combine new pics with previously drawn screen by alpha-channel.

  I going to clean up my fork, rebase commits with normal names, etc. After clean up i will continue to develop this.

  Also i going to add G13 and G502 to this driver.

  Requirements
--------------

  + Pyusb
  + Pillow
  + PyUserInput
  + [ambient_light](https://bitbucket.org/GRayHook/logiled_ambient/src/master/) from link above (It disable by default)
